# InfiniteFantasy
A lighthearted 2D Retro Style side-scrolling game that features many core Game Design concepts. Using Collision Detection, Physics-based kinematic algorithms, a live scoring system and a leaderboard database management system, this endless flight based game can have you playing for hours upon hours to reach your high score! This game is created from scratch by handling graphics rendered with OpenGL and the utilization of a very low level Pixel Game Engine that is incorporated enirely in C++. Video of gameplay is on my youtube channel in the link. Game is available per request.
